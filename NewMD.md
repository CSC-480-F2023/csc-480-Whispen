I learned about commits, merge requests, pull requests, and forking from this github introduction. Commits are a great way to keep track of what exactly is happening with each change that is being requested to merge into whatever branch you're currently trying to port too. Merge requests allow whoever is maintaining the destination branch to see differences between the old and new code and make a in-depth decision on what to merge. Pull requests allow you to tell your team members what you have done to a repository. Forking allows you to make a copy of a source branch to make a new repo where you can experiment without negatively effecting the already existing code.
